# Dictionary
Vocabulary teacher

## How it works?
- Open my google sheet, where are three column: words, meaning and help
- It makes a user defined quiz (number of words, number of wrong answers)
  - The word is spoken via audio
- You need to vote for the good answer

In case of wrong answer:
- you got a help (example sentence from the help column)
- the meaning of the word opens through collins dictionary
  - https://www.collinsdictionary.com/
  
- Date of the good/wrong answers are recorded in the same google sheet (for todo)


#### Other
- It opens when computer is switched on
  - can be automatize for timeperiods (open every hours, etc)


### TODO:
  - After a help sentence arises add NOK to the statistics
  - Handle if the sheet is not available (no internet, make local copy, etc)
